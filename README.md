# ‚ú® DiffTerm

**DiffTerm** is a terminal-based, side-by-side text diff tool designed for developers who work in the terminal‚Äîespecially those collaborating with AI.  
I created DiffTerm after noticing that AI-generated code often contains subtle mistakes or deviations from instructions. With DiffTerm, you can instantly compare two text blocks and visually spot changes at a glance‚Äîmaking AI-assisted coding safer, faster, and more reliable.

## üö© Why DiffTerm?

When coding in the terminal with AI, it's common to get code suggestions or completions that aren't exactly what you intended.  
**DiffTerm** lets you:
- Instantly paste and compare original and AI-generated code.
- See additions and deletions with clear color highlights, right in your terminal.
- Quickly verify if the AI followed your instructions, line by line.

## üé® How Diff Colors Display

- <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red text</span> = Removed text

> (If your Markdown viewer doesn‚Äôt support color, you‚Äôll see regular text. In the terminal, colors are always shown.)
